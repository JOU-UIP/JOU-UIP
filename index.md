# Welcome to JOU-UIP's Homepage

## Laboratory profile
**The underwater Information Processing Laboratory** of [Jiangsu Ocean University](https://www.jou.edu.cn/) has been focusing on the research of underwater information processing. The laboratory members mainly include **image quality evaluation methods, underwater optical imaging, machine learning, pattern recognition, FPGA embedded system development and other research directions**. The team aims to promote the application of artificial intelligence in the Marine field and explore the important value of Marine visual information for Marine scientific analysis, Marine mission decision system and prediction.

Professor Miao Yang, director of the laboratory, has been engaged in underwater visual information processing research for more than 10 years, including underwater image quality evaluation methods, underwater imaging process, classic image recovery, contrast enhancement, image segmentation and contour extraction, etc

## Research Interests:
Professor Yang's research interests include underwater vision, underwater image analysis and evaluation, pattern recognition, especially in
* **Underwater image quality evaluation**  
The purpose of image quality evaluation is to evaluate the degradation of human visual perception. The specific research topics are
  * Underwater image vector quality evaluation model
  * Evaluation method of underwater color image quality
  * Underwater image quality evaluation method based on multi-topic learning
  * Subjective quality assessment database
* **Underwater image enhancement**
The purpose is to improve the visual effect of the image for a given image application.The specific research topics are
  * Image enhancement method based on dark channel prior theory
  * Underwater color image enhancement based on light reflection decomposition
  * Effective estimation of background light in underwater image dehazing
* **Underwater object detection**
The purpose is to detect, identify and track underwater objects accurately, quickly and stably under the condition of poor image visibility.
